Hi Everyone 

I had a suggestion for those who are interested in no coding and tool based job : Data Governance. Learning Path is mostly learning #dama book and tools , get #certifications. I saw many especially people from #careerbreak looking out for #job seriously, attending #advertisements , #courses and loosing #money. So thought to #share this #option.

This is a very brief Study Road Map for Data Governance, Data Management, Data Security and Data Loss Prevention Concepts
